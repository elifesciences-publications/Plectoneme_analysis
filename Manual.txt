This analysis code is for the single-molecule DNA supercoil data. For details, see 'Ganji and Kim et al., 2016 Nano Letters, 16, 4699'.

This script is based on a script written by Marijn van Loenhout (van Loenhout et al., 2012 Science 338, 94) and Jacob Kerssemakers.

Data format
Fluorescence image data should be stored in tiff file format and each frame should be saved in a separate file and numbered sequentially (see example data set).

Procedure
1.	Run Master_analyzer.m
2.	In the commend window, enter the file path that contains the tiff files.
3.	The fluorescence image will be shown in a pop up window. And you will be asked to enter DNA number to analyze. If you have not analyze any DNA previously or if you want analyze a new DNA molecule in the image, enter 0.
4.	If you chose 0, then, cross hair cursor will show up and you can specify the position of the linearized DNA. Use left mouse button to click the start position of the DNA of interest and right mouse button for the end position. Then a close up image will be shown on the right. If you are satisfied with the clicking, then press middle mouse button. 
5.	Then the script will read all the tiff files in the folder and build an intensity kymograph of the DNA molecule, which will be shown in another figure window. In the kymograph, you can select frames that should be analyzed by clicking with left mouse button for start frame and right button for end frame. Middle button will terminate the selection process.
6.	Then you will be asked if another folder should be read for nicked DNA molecule. If your kymograph already shows nicking, then choose ¡®Select from current¡¯. If you have measured a torsionally relaxed DNA in other directory, chose ¡®Look up another folder.
7.	When a kymograph of a nick DNA shows up, repeat frame selection again.
8.	After building the kymograph of both coiled and nicked DNA, averaged intensity profiles of the nicked and coiled DNA will be displayed in another figure window.
9.	Then, you will be asked if you want to specify the DNA end positions manually or automatically. The automatically found end positions are shown with vertical lines in the intensity profiles.
10.	If you chose manual selection, then the cursor will be changed to cross hair type and you can click the end positions on the graph.
11.	Once the DNA end positions are set, the script will find plectonemes and calculate all the interesting parameters such as diffusion coefficient, size, position of the plectonemes, etc.
